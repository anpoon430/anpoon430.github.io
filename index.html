          ABOUT

        <blockquote>
            After my studies in Civil Engineering, I reaffirmed my interests were in designing creative solutions to solve problems. Studying Civil Engineering taught me to approach problem solving in a systematic way, but I realized that a career that was less restricted by codes and standards was more important to me. In search of a career where I could freely design solutions to problems, I began learning Python and JavaScript. Then I attended Fullstack Academy to learn Web Development in Node.js, Express, Sequelize, Postgres, React and Redux. I am looking for opportunities where I can apply my technical skills to be able to freely design solutions to problems and also apply my systematic problem solving approaches from Civil Engineering.
